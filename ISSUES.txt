------------------------------------- ERRORS -------------------------------------
Ownership of the card should be added to the card's object in the game object
Giant Trunade should only shuffle hands to which cards where returned
Rewrite code using synchronous callbacks
[Fixed] Attack position card must be shielded differently from defense position card
[Fixed] Glitch when trying to summon a 1-tribute monster after a 2-tribute monster
[Fixed] Card tooltip does not show when hovering over a card that requires tributes when the monster zone is full
[Fixed] game.afterDamage() must always reset itself
[Fixed] In "Monster Reborn", if monster is already on top, do not bring it to top
[Fixed] Bring card to the top and make it glow in "Sangan" and "Witch of the Black Forest"
[Fixed] Monster special summoned by "Monster Reborn" is not removed from the graveyard
[Fixed] Continue implementation of reopenLastDiag
[Fixed] "Monster Reborn" should allow summoning in face-up defense position.
[Fixed] When damage is zero, game.status does not revert to "idle"
[Fixed] After designating cards for an effect, the status stays at fieldSelect for a while, allowing more than the required number of cards to be selected.

------------------------------------- NOTES --------------------------------------
"Monster Reborn" splices out the first card with the given ID in the graveyard

-------------------------------- CODE REFACTORING --------------------------------
Refactor function bringToTop
Refactor function applpyDamage (first check for position then for damage value)
[Done] Remove function removeArrElement and replace all instances with splice
Replace all loops on nodelists with foreach loops.
[Done] Use Array.prototype.some and Array.prototype.every instead of map and filter in checkActivationConditions
[Done] Use bitwise-anding with 1 for parity check
[Done] Use the spread operator instead of Array.concat()
Replace querySelector() and querySelectorAll() with shorthand functions ($ and $$)

----------------------------------- AESTHETICS -----------------------------------
After activating "Monster Reborn" card should first be brought to the top before position is asked for
Disable arrows/scrollbar in view diag when there are less than 6 cards
